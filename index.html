    <p>We know that leaving in isolation can be difficult, so lets try to make it better with virtual reality. This is not a
    game, is a safe space where you can build a community and explore unknown places. But better than that, you can keep
    calm and stay together with your loved ones. Enjoy the trip!</p>
